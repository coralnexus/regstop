# regstop
A simple registration stopper that lets you specify domains that are not allowed to register.

To use:

1: Install just like any other Drupal module
2: Configure RegStop permissions at Admin > People > Permissions
3: Configure domains + failure message at Admin > Configure > People > RegStop

That's it...

Blocked submissions will appear in the Watchdog logs under the RegStop
category.
